*Ever feel like you have too much feeds to check every day?* 
  
Yep. I feel that too.

As someone who has tons of interests in different fields, sometimes there are days where i spent hours just checking my feeds. Cyber Security, Aviation, DOTA2, Girl's frontline, homelab & self-host, etc. It's quite a daunting task to keep up with wildly different topics at the same time. Admittedly, i've been looking for a simple solution that doesn't require much maintenance to no avail. A few weeks ago, i came across [Glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance), a relatively new self-hosted dashboard app. Their tagline quickly got me hooked:

>  #### *What if you could see everything at a.... <strong>Glance</strong>*  
  
The idea is simple. Host an instance of the dashboard app by yourself. Then, you can start adding things you wanted to keep track as widgets. Here's several things that's available out of the box:
- Hacker News feed
- Subreddit feed
- RSS feed
- Youtube channels
- Twitch channels
- Server status (via ICMP ping)
- Calendar
- Weather
- Docker Container status
- Github releases

And many more. You can check the full list of available widgets [here](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/configuration.md). There are even some community-made widgets such as minecraft server status, Cat as a Service/CaaS photos (*yes, i'm dead serious*), Nearby Aircrafts, etc.

## Requirements

1. Docker & Docker Compose
2. Reverse Proxy, such as Traefik, Caddy or NGINX.  
Not really mandatory, but nice to have for additional access control & port forwarding. I will use NGINX in this article.

## Getting Started

I decided to use the recommended ***docker compose*** method. The app will be hosted on my own home server to ensure i have access to the same dashboard on every devices. Of course, you can deploy it on your local docker container, VPS, or anywhere else that supports docker.  On this guide, i will also be using [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) to simplify the container & stack management.

1. First, create a docker stack on the Stacks -> Add Stack menu.

2. Then, add the following `docker-compose.yml` file content:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  glance:
    container_name: glance
    image: glanceapp/glance
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /home/docker/glance:/app/config # change to your liking, this will be the location for glance config
    ports:
      - 5000:8080 # change to your liking. format is [external-port]:[internal-port]
```

In the example above, i mapped the internal config to my home folder, `/home/docker/glance`, and expose the app on port `5000`. This means that the Glance app will be available at **\<my-server-ip\>:5000** later on.

3. Navigate to your mapped directory, and create a `glance.yml`. For starter, you can find the default template [here](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/glance.yml). Simply paste the content to your `glance.yml` file. 

```bash
cd /home/docker/glance && touch glance.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml > glance.yml
```

4. And that's it. You're pretty much done. If you're using Portainer, you can just click `Deploy the stack` button. Or, if you fancy command line:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Setting Up NGINX

This step isn't really required, but i highly recommend it for easier access to your dashboard. 

1. Assuming you have NGINX, navigate to your config folder. Usually it is located at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
```

2. Create a new config file, for example `glance`:

```bash
sudo touch glance
```

3. Add the following content to your config file:

```nginx title="glance"
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name glance.docker.asthene.local; # change to your liking

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        }
}
```
You can change the `server_name` to whatever you like. I used `glance.docker.asthene.local` for this example.

4. Test the NGINX configuration, and restart the service:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Now your Glance app should be available at your domain. For example, mine is available at  http://glance.docker.asthene.local (*obviously, it's a local address so you can't see it*).

## Configuring widgets

Now that you have the app running, you can start adding widgets to your dashboard. Don't worry, you don't need any sysadmin or devops knowledge to write the config file. It's as simple as writing a word document.

For example, to subscribe to a RSS feed, you can add the following section:

```yaml
widgets:
  - type: rss
    name: My RSS Feed
    url: [Some RSS feed URL]
    limit: 5
```

The options are pretty much straightforward. `name` is the name that will show up on your dashboard, `url` is the feed's url, and `limit` limits how many entries are pulled at once.


Or you can subscribe to several youtube channels and automatically fetch the latest videos:

```yaml
widgets:
  - type: videos
    channels:
      - [Youtube channel ID]
      - [Youtube channel ID]
    limit: 5
```

You can find the details on how to obtain the Channel IDs [here](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#videos).

Finally, simply set the default homepage of your favorite browser or app to the Glance's URL. Now,  you can start your day with a Glance (*pun intended*).
